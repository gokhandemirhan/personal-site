Okay here is the thing. I like Plex, I like it a lot and it has a great way of displaying the movies and series you have, but I also miss the old times when I got a DVD from the library, open its cover, slide it in to the DVD player and enjoy it. It makes me feel a bit cosy seeing the DVDs on the racks especially the triologies with their special covers.

So I came up with an idea of having the DVDs again but with a QR code when scanned it will open that movie on Plex, and looks like its totally doable.
